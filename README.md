# recommender_system
About the project:
Bachelor’s thesis
In my bachelor’s project I had to create a system, that recommends sightseeing spots in Lithuania. I created a web page, where an user can choose which places he wants to see and after user choses a particular place, the system finds similar places to chosen place, which was achieved by using content-based algorithm. The user can also register which lets him rate places he checked, then the system can recommend places similar to places an user rated positively.
Technologies used in this project:
